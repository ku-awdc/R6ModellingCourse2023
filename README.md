# R6ModellingCourse2023

A repository for an experimental course on object-oriented disease modelling using R6 (and maybe C++)

The current plan for topics to cover is:

1. Wednesday 17th May (90 mins + beers)
  - When should we create an R package?
  - How should we create an R package?
  - Tour of an R package structure
  - Basics of functions and S3 classes
  - Basics of git
  - Introduction to unit tests and R CMD check
  
2. Wednesday 31st May (90 mins)
  - Good programming practice:  encapsulation, version control, testing, vignettes, help files
  - Programming styles:  procedural vs functional vs object oriented
  - Introduction to R6
  - Disease modelling using R6 (discrete-time mechanistic models)
  - Inheritance and importing other packages

3. Wednesday 14th June (90 mins + beers)
  - Object-oriented disease modelling using BLOFELD
  - Modularising populations, spread mechanisms, control mechanisms, and book-keeping functions
  - TBC: iGraph, sf
  
4. Wednesday 28th June (90 mins)
  - TBC: Rcpp, template meta-programming  
  
Then we will have a summer break, and possibly (probably?) continue in September/October

All meetings will be hybrid - contact Matt for the Zoom link if you don't already have it.
